# Machine-Learning-Prediction-using-LIME-Library
Performed  feature selection based on the set of generated textual explanations in order to improve the classifierâ€™s performance.


Explored text data to validate sentiment analysis. More specifically, we used the 20 newsgroups text corpus, and focus only on two classes, Atheism and Christianity. The provided ML
model takes in this text corpus and performs binary classification to predict for a given document if it has Atheistic or Christian sentiment.
We worked with improving the prediction output of this model. Note that this model is built in Spark using its machine learning libraries ML and MLlib, and so you will be working
with Spark data structures.
